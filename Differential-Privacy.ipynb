First introduced by Dwork et al. in [1], and further detailed in [2]. It states that an algorithm is  differentially private if, given two **close** databases, it produces statistically indistinguishable outputs.\n","Formally, a randomized algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ is $\\epsilon$-differentially private if for any output $Z$ and for any two close databases $X$ and $X'$, $$\\mathbb{P}[\\mathcal{A}(X) \\in Z] \\leq e^{\\epsilon}\\mathbb{P}\\left[\\mathcal{A}(X') \\in Z\\right]. \\text{   } (1)$$\n","Where the probability space is over the coin flips of $\\mathcal{A}$.\n","\n","Here, $\\mathbb{P}[\\mathcal{A}(X) \\in Z]$ is the probability of a\n","randomized function $\\mathcal{A}$ to ouput a value in $Z$ when evaluating\n","it on a given dataset $X$. The right side is identical to the left except\n","that the function is now evaluated on a dataset $X'$ that differs from $X$\n","in at most one element (hence the notion of **closness**). And finally, $\\epsilon$ is a parameter that describes\n","how much information is leaked by the function.\n","\n","\n","Sounds pretty abstract, so let's work out a simple example: Let's assume we want to build a differentially private dataset from the adult data that we've looked at in the first session. The goal here is to protect an adversary from gaining too much information about the sensitive attribute (income > 50k or not) when adding that Alice's data to the dataset. With differential privacy, we look at the state of the dataset before and after Alice was added and quantify the privacy loss as given by equation (1). Let us suppose that $\\mathcal{A}$ outputs the total number of persons with income > 50k in deterministic fashion. Then by simply comparing the output value of $\\mathcal{A}$ before and after the adding Alice to the dataset, we can infer with certainty what kind of income Alice has. This highlights the fact that any deterministic analysis of a dataset represents a security breach, this is why the curator is needed to input some kind of randomness that will help preserving privacy.\n","\n","\n","\n","Let us now investigate a simple randomization trick called **randomized response**. It works as follows:\n","\n","* With probability $1-p$, we add a Alice's true income value to the database.\n","* With probability $p$ we choose a random boolean (0/1) value from a distribution returning $0$ with probability $q$ and $1$ with probability $1-q$ and add that value to the database instead.\n","\n","**We denote 0/1 for generality, but for our application 1 means \"income > 50k\" and 0 means \"income =< 50k\"**\n","\n","Using this scheme, an attacker cannot know with certainty if the real attribute value of Alice or a random one was added to the database. This protects the privacy of Alice but of course it also adds noise to the database, making it more difficult to use for legitimate users as well. In practice, we therefore always need to weigh privacy against utility when employing differential privacy. In this notebook, we will calculate the $\\epsilon$ and other relevant parameters for our scheme above and see how we can use this differentially private data to make predictions about the \n","income distribution of the people in our dataset.\n","\n","* [1] [Differential privacy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/differential-privacy/)\n","* [2] [The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf)\n","\n","\n","## Calculating $\\epsilon$\n","\n","In our differentially private scheme, the probability of adding the true attribute value to the database is $1-p$. The probability of adding a random value is therefore $p$ and the probability of that value being $0$ is $q$. So how can we relate this to eq. (1)? Well, we can set $X$ and $X'$ as the versions of our database **before** and **after** adding Alice's data to it. Let's say that before adding Alice there are $k$ $1$'s in the database. We can then use a query $\\mathcal{A}$ that returns the number of $1$'s in the database and choose our result set as $Z = \\{n\\}$. Before adding Alice to the database, $\\mathcal{A}(X)=k$ with certainty, hence $\\mathbb{P}(\\mathcal{A}(X) = k)=1$. After adding Alice's data, the probability that the query result is still $k$ can be calculated as follows, depending on the Alice's attribute value:\n","\n","* If Alice's attribute value is $0$, the probability that $\\mathcal{A}$ is unchanged after adding the data to the database is given as $1-p+p\\cdot q$.\n","* If a Alice's attribute value is $1$, the probability that $\\mathcal{A}$ is unchanged after adding the data to the database is given as $p\\cdot q$.\n","\n","We therefore have the two equations\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{eqnarray}\n","\\mathbb{P}[\\mathcal{A}(X) \\in Z | x_i=1] & = & 1 \\le \\exp{\\epsilon}\\cdot \\mathbb{P}[\\mathcal{\n","A}(X') \\in Z | x_i=1] = \\exp{\\epsilon}\\cdot p \\cdot q \\\\\n","\\mathbb{P}[\\mathcal{A}(X) \\in Z | x_i=0] & = & 1 \\le \\exp{\\epsilon}\\cdot \\mathbb{P}[\\mathcal{A}(X') \\in Z | x_i=0] = \\exp{\\epsilon}\\cdot (1-p+p \\cdot q) \\\\\n","\\end{eqnarray}\n","$$\n","\n","This leads to\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{eqnarray}\n","\\epsilon & \\ge & -\\ln{\\left(p \\cdot q\\right)} \\\\\n","\\epsilon & \\ge & -\\ln{\\left(1-p+p\\cdot q\\right)} \\\\\n","\\end{eqnarray}\n","$$\n","\n","Since we're interested in an upper bound for $\\epsilon$ and since $-\\ln{\\left(1-p+p\\cdot q\\right)} \\le -\\ln{p\\cdot q}$, we get\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\epsilon = -\\ln{\\left(p\\cdot q\\right)}\n","\\end{equation}\n","$$\n","\n","\n","## Exercise \n","\n","* To your point of view, what value of $\\epsilon$ represent a good enough uncertainty for the adversary? \n","* How does the level of privacy evolve when $\\epsilon$ gets bigger/smaller? \n","* Same question for the accuracy of $\\mathcal{A}$."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DzhXUrgnVarG"},"source":["\n","\n","$\\epsilon$ represents a metric of privacy loss at a differentially change in data (adding, removing 1 entry).

differentially private data, we want of course to make use of it! For example, we might want to estimate the probability of a person having an income > 50K based on the data we've collected, which we assume is Bernoulli distributed with a probability $p_{1}$ for every individual in the database. Now, when adding up the data from $n$ persons, the resulting value is binomially distributed. The mean of this distribution is given as $\\mathbb{E}_{1} = n\\cdot p_{1}$ and the variance as $\\mathbb{V}_1 = n\\cdot p_1 \\cdot (1-p_1)$. A consistent and unbiased estimator of $\\mathbb{E}_1$ is $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}_{1} = \\sum_i x_i$, which then gives an estimate for $p_{1}$ of $\\hat{p}_{1} = \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}_1/n$.\n","\n","Now, if we apply the differential privacy mechanism to our dataset, the probability of obtaining a $1$ will change to $p_{1,dp} = (1-p)\\cdot p_{1}+p\\cdot(1-q)$. Therefore, an unbiased and consistent estimator of $p_1$ based on $p_{1,dp}$ is given as\n","$$\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{\\hat{p}_{1,dp}-p\\cdot(1-q)}{1-p}\n","\\end{equation}\n","$$\n","\n","As before, $\\hat{p}_{1,dp}=\\sum_i x_{i,dp}/n$.
